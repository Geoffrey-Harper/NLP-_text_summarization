earlier today i was at the local county fair in the lovely county of adams in wisconsin i was there to enjoy the fair help out and have a wonderful day however later in the afternoon i found myself in the rabbit chicken duck goose and dairy barn i was behind a row of rabbit cages with my cousin which bordered up to the wooden fence divider between the rabbits and dairy cows this beautiful heifer decided she wanted to poke her head through to the rabbit side  for what i thought was to get a good scratch behind the ears and on her bump she however had other thoughts she was just interested in getting the bucket of water on the floor that was meant for watering the rabbits when i reached down to scratch her she tolerated it for about 10 15 seconds at the end of those few seconds i was looking away speaking to my husband son and cousin all of a sudden a loud thwack and searing pain in my right hand i looked down and she had my hand squished in between her headhead bump and the wooden fence post in the barn after i got my hand loose about ten seconds after the initial hit it was already turning purple with a huge blood pool underneath my middle finger nail as well as the base of the nail was bleeding in the cuticle my other finger nails felt like i had played that stupid bite down on them as hard as you can then push your fingers together game so as of right now my hand is still in serious pain the nail is purple and has some serious blood build up underneath it as well all the rest of the blood vessels in the top of my finger have burst so its about three times the size it should be so this is how i screwed my hand up by fucking up and mistaking a heifers want for water as the want for attention
