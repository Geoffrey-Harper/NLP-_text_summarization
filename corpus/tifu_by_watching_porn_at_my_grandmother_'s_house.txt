this actually happened a while ago but so did everything else on this sub this fuck up happened whilst i was still in highschool i lived very far away from my highschool so during my senior year i lived with my grandmother to save money on petrol as you can imagine my grandmother is not an avid user of the internet but i am i implored her to change to a shaped plan a shaped plan is where instead of charging you extra when you go over your data allowance they slow your throughput with no further charges she refused because technology is scary if she had just taken my advice i would not be writing this post highschool was a very frustrating time for me i grew hair where there was no hair before and i felt the urges that all teenage boys feel my room had a computer in it and i consistently went over our data allowance with pornography every single month that i lived with my grandmother since the allowance was so restrictive i chose to download and store all of the porn videos locally for later use in a single folder called something along the lines of biology homework because teenagers like to think that they are clever when they are really not i even cleared the browser history because obviously i did frustrated but in a different angrier way my grandmother called her isp to dispute a huge bill that my penis had accrued  ladies the isp emailed her my download history which included a lot of visits to various tube porn sites my grandmother not fully understanding that her download limit encompasses page views as well as downloaded files decided to search through all of my folders and yes she found lots and lots of my dirty dirty porn now my grandmother is not stupid obviously a teenage boy is going to look at internet porn she opened one of the aforementioned locally stored videos she was not prepared for what she saw my grandmother was married at 19 so she has not exactly been around the block what she saw was in an entirely different suburb when i got home from school she confronted me i owned up to everything because i did not think that it was that big of a deal but i moved back home anyway because my grandmother could not deal with the monetary cost of my habits
