nothing too exciting with this tifu i already submitted my university applications earlier and there is pressure on my parents to attend university because it is more prestigious and the odds of me getting a career post grad is higher than college i also think it is part of their own benefit but i wanted to apply to both because there is a prestigious animation program at a college 1 city away from here where many of pixar disney and other industry giants employees are recruited from it is a dream of mine to be an animator and definitely a pixar animator but i knew my drawing skills were not up to par but i thought it would be worth the application anyways the only thing holding me back was the 95 fee to apply i tried to pay for it myself because i knew i would have no support from my parents   but my card was declined each time i tried and my mom said i should think about it more before i apply all while speaking in a saddenedangered tone i had not even asked my dad because i knew what his reaction would be this was yesterday lone behold today i log in to the college site and one of my program choices is gone animation the application queue for the program is full and they are not accepting anymore should have just manned up and stood up for myself instead now i have to wait another year to apply   while i am a freshman in uni
