i work as sales in a manufacturingdistributing company that sells paper and plastic products long story short a distributor contacts me and is interested in spoons requests prices i give and then orders he gives me a card over email which i should have suspected but i did not since it was a large amount of  and i am based on commission i try the card and it works we do two other transactions throughout the month each card is under a different name and address it all clears another stupid move on my part today i am told the company that i have been working with is a fraud company all the credit cards i have been using were stolen and all the products are gone thankfully the last shipment we sent out was a local storage warehouse and we claimed about 8k back but still pretty shitty atleast now i know i probably will not lose my job
