i was a freshman in high school i was in my last period class biology of course my add kicked in and it was extremely hard for me to concentrate on what the teacher was talking about so i pull out a small spiral with like 200 pages in it earlier that week i had started a sort of insider with my friends to make a new type of meme called sometimes i jokes these jokes always began by saying sometimes i and never made any sense whatsoever especially not to someone who was not in on the joke if i remember correctly here was one of the jokes
sometimes i pretend i am john lennon and fondle mojo jojos tits like i said these jokes had absolutely no point to them at all there i was writing in that notebook when my biology teacher realized i was not paying attention she walked over to my desk took my spiral and continued teaching in my mind i was panicking i was so scared after class she called me up to her desk and the worst thing imaginable happens she opens the spiral with my terrible luck she of course happened to flip to the worst joke in the whole book
sometimes i rip my balls off with a chainsaw and then staple them back together what the fuck was i thinking when i wrote those i was immediately sent to the principal my parents were called and every joke was read to them every single one
