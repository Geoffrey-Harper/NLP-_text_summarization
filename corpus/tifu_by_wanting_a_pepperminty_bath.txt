today i was going to have a bath after a long day of painting kids faces at a carnival all would go well except being the genius i am i put in some epsom salts i always do for my bath and i grabbed my bottle of peppermint essential oil lately i have been on a diy pinterest tumblr let us make my own shit and be fancy spree the other day i took a detox bath fyi did nothing for me guys uselessss so my brain totally went hey trajectorys put some peppermint in it is good for your skin okay brain so instead of logically putting in like 5 drops so it is nice and minty fresh smelling and just enough to work i literally shook the thing full force all over the top of the bath water i am talking like probably 50 100 drops so i finish running the water turn it off and hop in first five minutes went really well and then the cold started okay this is fine it just is the peppermint cooling my skin brain is like just wait it out so i stayed in ten minutes in and i am moving back and forth trying to keep the warm water warm if i stopped moving it was like sitting in the water at the foot of a glacier so i sit up you know that feeling when you brush your teeth and drink ice water that immense cold in your mouth my back felt like that immediately so now i am sitting here and my back my butt and my ladybits are burning cold like sitting in the snow naked kind of cold it is really uncomfortable so indeed tifu
