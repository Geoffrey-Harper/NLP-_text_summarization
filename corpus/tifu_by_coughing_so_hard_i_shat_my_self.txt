so recently i have come down with a nasty upper respiratory infection and have been coughing a lot today i was sitting in the cafeteria at my college when i felt a particularly big cough coming on it was a very effective cough and apparently too effective because instantly i realized i had shat my pants while some may have been embarrassed i was actually quite excited after spending so much time reading about people who shat them selves you start to wonder what it feels like well now i know
