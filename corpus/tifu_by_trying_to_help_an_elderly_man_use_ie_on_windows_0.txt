okay so i just got off work today and i had to tell this story somewhere i work in a call center for a cable company for their tech support today i got a specific call about something along the lines of when i open internet explorer all that comes up is a giant white screen and i can never close out of the pages
at first i thought maybe he hit f11 and it because the browser to go full screen in the end i figured out he was actually using the new windows 8 operating system and just did not know how to navigate it whatsoever i am not an expert on windows 8 by any means but i thought i would at least give him a brief tutorial just to help him out even though it was out of my support boundaries this guy was bounced from line to line and no one was willing to help him so why would not i make his day just a bit better by doing him this one favor well for one this guy was a bit strange he was an older man and 5 minutes into the call he let me know how beautiful of a voice i have asked me my age and where i am located basically any information i was allowed to give out he repeated my name multiple times and just kept talking about how pretty my voice apparently is on the phone i did not think much of it until we got to me showing him how to use his os over the phone i talked him through typing in an address in the actual address bar at the bottom of the page on windows 8 and prompted him to type in a code which would allow me to remotely access his computer and navigate ittype stuff on ituse a highlighteretc in order to show him how to use the computer first things first let us delete all those open tabs
lucky me i guess half those tabs were porn straight up porn my favorite had to have been the daddy daughter massage play definitely had me rethinking those questions i answered earlier in the call anyways when the tabs opened i heard him on the other line say oh hello there and i about died laughing the rest of the call was super awkward and now i am pretty sure i have a phobia of old men calling me for technical support but at least it is over
