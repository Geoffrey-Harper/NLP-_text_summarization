i work in a students union in an office upstairs my friend works on the reception right in the middle of the main entrance foyer downstairs we both are big fans of the walking dead and are both pretty much up to the same point in the series her always being a few episodes ahead we love to discuss the show after i have caught up so i was very excited as i made my way down the stairs one morning to talk about the episode i had watched the previous evening i was so excited that when i came to the foyer with my friend behind her desk facing me on the opposite side of the entrance hall i could not help but start lumbering towards her head cocked arms writhing and outstretched loudly snarling moaning and groaning doing the best zombie impression i could i thought it would make my friend laugh excite her for the upcoming zombie conversation and also to try and distract her while she dealt with the lone customer who was stood with her back to me talking to her the hall was almost empty save the girl with her back to me as i lurched ever nearer i was confused as to why my friend was not smiling at my funny joke but instead looking horrified and almost frozen with panic it was too late before i realized why only two paces from the girl with her back to me i continued with my brilliant impression idiotically ignoring my friends grimace and instead increasing the vigor of my performance as i drew nearer all at once with horror i realized what i was doing i heard the girls voice as she noticed me and spun around i could not break character fast enough we locked eyes my face contorted arms akimbo body bent she had downs syndrome she thought i was mocking her the world stood still as my friend paralyzed by the proximity of my shame and shock stared at me mouth agape i had no words i locked eyes with the stranger for what felt like eons before turning tail and fleeing outside fortunately there were few people about the entrance hall and reception area is usually packed so only the three of us know my cringe worthy shame
