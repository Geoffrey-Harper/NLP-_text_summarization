let me start off my saying i know it is only forty bucks so its kind of whatever but just listen so i went to the dump for my mom which is about three minutes down the road i get there with my two bags of trash which costs a buck i pay the guy and get these ticket things you throw down the chute with the garbage i put the garbage down the chute and reach in my pocket and grab the stickers and throw them down with the bags i drive home let my dogs out and then empty my pockets so i could take off my jacket and i find the two stickers still in my pocket so i am thinking to myself i swear i just threw them down the chute then it hit me and i reached in my pocket and of course my two nice crisp twenties were missing so i flew back to the garbage man going 65 in a 35 with a jeep cherokee mind you almost flipped my jeep on the way and when i get there i explain the problem to the guy what does he say just ran the compressor about a minute ago sorry bud keep the two stickers for next time though all i could think was fuck fuck asked the guy if he knew what reddit was he was old and of course said no but i told him i was putting it on here despite the fact he was probably thinking this kids a fuckin moron then went home and went directly to my ipad to inform the reddit community how much of a dumbass i am
