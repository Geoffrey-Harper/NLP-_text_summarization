barely even 10 days ago my mom got me a brand new samsung galazxy s4 for christmas anyways last night i went to my friends birthday party and after the party ended my drunk self thought it would be a good idea to walk home the walk probably took around 2 hours but luckily it was not raining or too cold midway through my little adventure home i realized that i did not have my phone the problem here is that i do not remember if i had my phone when i left my friends house i told my friend what happened and asked him to keep me updated if he finds it or not but i have yet to hear back from him i am really worried that it somehow fell out of my pocket when i was walking home i tried using the android device manager to track my phone but i am quite sure my phone was out of batteries by the time i tried tracking it down best christmas ever
