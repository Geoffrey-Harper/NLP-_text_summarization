so today was pretty horrible for me also throwaway because some people i know at school browse reddit and this subreddit quite frequently and the last thing i need is someone to find out all of my dirty secrets
today was one of the last days of school last official day for seniors is friday and we had gotten our yearbooks last friday everyone has been signing each others yearbooks and i was happy when i got to my first period because it means that i get to see my crush a little background is in order i am a girl and so is the girl i like i am bisexual and i have not come out of the closet yet and i am not quite ready to i plan on doing it soon but it is not just something i want to do overnight anyway i have liked her for about three years and we are going to different colleges we have first period together and i would say we are friendly acquaintances but not quite friends earlier in the year i got this bright idea to write a ridiculous love poem that i would put in her locker i do not know why the hell i decided to do it but i decided to do it the poem is okay it is not too cringy but it is not that bad it is basically proclaiming my love for her from an anonymous person and saying that i will always have a place in my heart for her so this weekend i printed out the letter and i decided to seal it up nicely and put it in her locker i left my 0 period class to go put it in her locker so that no one would see me all went according to plan and i thought i was in the clear then i went to first period so in first period we are passing around yearbooks i had this whole note planned out where i told her how much she impacted my life and etc it was just supposed to be in a friendly way with no romantic overtones then i got distracted and got up for a second when i came back i forgot what i was writing i finished the note and when i went to sign my name i put a heart next to it with my name which was typical then i put i love you i did not realize my mistake until i was handing it back to her luckily she does not read them until after we are done at school but i am freaking out about the consequences of this i am sure someone will notice and say something also i am not the kind of girl who says i love you randomly to other girls it seems out of place when i do it and almost everyone knows so there is not any writing this off as an accident
