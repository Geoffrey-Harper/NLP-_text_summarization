ok so this happened a couple weeks ago in my research lab this might be a little confusing if you are not a scientist or chemist but i will try to make it readable for you non scientists out there btw i am an undergraduate researcher so you can imagine some of the stupidity that will ensue i work in a lab that tries to make crystals to see if a unique chemical structure is formed one time i was using ethanol alcohol as a solvent for my reaction and i knew that the product formed from the reaction would not crystallize with ethanol so i had to vaporize the ethanol out of the solution by heating the solution beaker on a hot plate once the ethanol was vaporized i was left with the product in the hotwarm beaker now this is an aside for some reason or another the graduate tas and research educator prof i work with in the lab do not use the vent hood for many dangerous chemicals like dichloromethane maybe its because they find it inconvenient to work in the hood or maybe its because they work with dichloromethane so much they kind of forget about its dangers so i thought since they do not use a hood when using dichloromethane then maybe i do not need to for the sake of efficiency stupid mistake very stupid in case you do not know the dangers of dichloromethane the first thing you have to know is that it is potentially carcinogenic the second thing is that if you inhaleconsume enough of it then you canwill get carbon monoxide poisoning because dichloromethane is metabolized into carbon monoxide carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to temporary blindnessblurriness the third thing is that dichloromethane has a relatively low boiling point temperature point at which the liquid turns into a gas that you can breathe now that the solid product is in my hotwarm beaker with no liquid ethanol i am supposed to dissolve the product in dichloromethane so that it will crystallize in a couple days ok so here is when things go outta hand i start to add dichloromethane into the beaker and i notice that the dichloromethane was vaporizing like when you add water to hot skillet when you are washing it after you used it on the stove i thought no big deal i do this all the time to cool down pots and stuff at home no harm done wrong the next second i took a normal breath of air and my lungs sank like an anvil dropping to the bottom of an ocean i realized what i had just done to myself i immediately put the beaker into a vent hood and started breathing heavy to try and get as much dichloromethane out of my system as possible i knew it was too late but then i assured myself that i did not breathe too much because i only put in like a couple mls of dichloromethane into the beaker i left lab and went outside for like 30 minutes and thankfully i did not feel any strong effects due to the dichloromethane except for blurriness in my eyes for a couple minutes i think the blurriness may have come from the placebo effect of knowing the side effects of inhaling dichloromethane bc i was thinking of that first i think i am lucky to be alive reddit tifu and plan on not fucking up again in lab by being a shit ton more safe rather than being efficient
