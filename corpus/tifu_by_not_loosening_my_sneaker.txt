yesterday evening my mother and i were walking through the mall i turned my head to the left and saw a beautiful casual dress in the window of hot topic black with a pink galaxy pattern and white stars it looked like someone had put pictures from a telescope on it seeing that the dress was only twenty five dollars my mom agreed to buy it for me as a reward for my good grades if they had it in my size i went inside and a very nice but pushy saleslady showed me to the dressing room in the back to try it on there was a rather short velvet curtain covering the entrance it was knee height on me and had to be hooked to the side of the wall i stood in the middle of the dressing room so i could not be seen through the small gap between the curtain and the wall and to read an article about death cab for cutie that was pasted to the low ceiling at that moment i decided i wanted to see how the dress would look with the high tops i was wearing at the moment after struggling to get my jeans off over my giant feet i realized the shoes looked stupid and tried to take them off this was where the fuckup came for some odd reason i did not sit down on the nearby bench or lean on a wall i stood in the middle of the closet sized room on one leg and began trying to pull off my right shoe however the shoelaces are too small and even with the bow undone i could not get it off instead of merely sitting down i continued to pull at the shoe balancing there a fireball of pain exploded in my left thigh the leg i was balancing on in my quest to remove my shoe i had been putting a lot of strain on my left thigh muscle which now gave out the sudden pain made me lose my balance and i pitched forward falling through the velvet curtain and onto the floor of the hot topic the dress took this opportunity and fly up exposing my underwear and the back of my bra the pushy saleslady grabbed a clothes rack on wheels and rolled it forward to shield me from the rest of the store but i know a few people saw me five minutes later i staggered out limping and we bought the dress
