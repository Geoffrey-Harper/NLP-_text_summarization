i went on a road trip to visit my mom last week it was my first time driving to nyc my map app told me that it was a toll road so i pulled out 20 cash thinking it would be plenty i am from the midwest and i have never paid a toll that was higher than maybe 4 i have made the drive up i95 as far north as baltimore all the way down to ga and i knew there were not any tolls until i went under the harbor and that one was only a few bucks i felt prepared i pay a couple of tolls totaling 12 and now i am on the jersey turnpike i glanced at my ticket and assume that the 8 i have left should cover my toll just fine i have not actually zoomed out of my route at all and have just been trusting the map to tell me where i am going turns out it does not even matter because i get in the wrong lane and end up being forced through the ez pass i do not have one there is no way to back up or turn around cars are honking at me because i am pretty much panicking at this point my kids are in the car asking me what is going on and i have no choice but to go forward and hope that i am not committing a felony or something from there on it is rapid fire exits and the start of intense traffic going into the city there is no place to pull over and pull more cash nor did it even occur to me to do so because by now i am no longer on an interstate however a few miles down the road and there is another tollbooth and they want 12 which of course i do not have because nothing in my years of interstate travel through middle america has prepared me for how much tolls are on the east coast she waves me through and i feel like crying i have taken cross country road trips alone with 4 kids since they were babies and have never once felt as stupid and incapable as i did then fast forward to today and i get a bright orange envelope in the mail it is an ez pass citation not only do i owe them 13  for the toll but i am charged an extra 50 as a fine i am praying that the other toll i owe does not have the same fee added to it ironically enough on the way home i accidentally picked a route consisting of state roads and did not realize it at first i literally paid 3 in tolls and shaved 2 hours off the trip by avoiding backed up metro traffic but guess who had 150 in my purse just waiting for a tollbooth to materialize on the horizon
