average day at work not too busy not too slow either i just recently quit drinking so i am not completely focused today not that my job really requires my 100 focus 100 of the time anyways so i am getting by just fine i am getting ready to go on my break while waiting for another co worker to come in at 5 he is usually late so i decided to just go before he gets there figure what is a few minutes anyways so i head up stairs to get my headphones so i can drown out whoevers outside i walk out of the department and quickly glance behind me to if he is there bam i hear a crack fuck my first reaction was i knocked something over and it smashed on the ground nope i turn around to see this little girl her head laying on the floor and beginning to cry her fucking eyes out her mom runs over and picks her up with my apologizing relentlessly even after i come back down the stairs with my stuff still feel fucking horrible about this she seemed to be ok just upset like any kid would be but still cannot stop thinking about it and how that little girls doing now
