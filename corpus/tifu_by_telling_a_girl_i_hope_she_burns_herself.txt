this happened a few years back so i know its not today but its my cake day and i do what i want so i was working at a fast food restaurant working the grill it was a particularly busy day and i did not have a lot of experience on the grill i was working with a few good friends and this girl let us call her cathy now cathy has burns on about 90 of her body which is very unfortunate but cathy is also a huge bitch cathy was working transferbasically taking hamburger patties and putting them on the buns so you can imagine what happens next cathy is waiting for me to finish up a couple of patties but i know they have another half a minute or so until she should take them then all of a sudden a wild order appears i think it was grilled onions or jalapenos and some grilled chicken so i throw these down real quick and start to go to town in the process of this cathy tells me that she needs my meat i tell her to give me a couple seconds but that was not quick enough for her she decides in horrible fashion that she is just going to grab it off the grill so in my blatant ignorance i say i hope you burn yourself the mistake i just made quickly pours over me but before i have time to correct myself and apologize she replies with  i already have i immediately feel the daggers of empathy go through my heart and try to apologize but the damage is done and i realize that everyone around me is just staring fuck
