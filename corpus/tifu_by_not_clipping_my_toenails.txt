because my nails are super thick and i have scissors instead of clippers i tend to forget clipping them every now and then causing them to get super long and and some cases super fragile while i was pacing around killing time by listening to music i stumbled down the mini steps into the hallway sending my right big toe smashing into the back of my left foot sure it hurt like a bitch for a second but i would done it before and did not think it was that serious until i got into my room and saw the blood on my foot turns out my nail was so long the leverage from the impact cracked it in half horizontally and sent the sharp interior edge down into the nail bed causing insane amounts of bleeding have i mentioned yet that i am hemophobic probably should have mentioned that now because i also fucked up by not getting new sneakers recently and my only pair squeezes the hell out of my toes i am going to have to wear flip flops in fourty degree weather
