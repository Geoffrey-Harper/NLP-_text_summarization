i was at my grandparents farm today just walking around when i stumbled across a blue egg just sitting on the ground it actually looked whole but when i picked it up i noticed it had a few holes in it where the unborn bird must have leaked out it still had some weight to it though so i figured that i could just take it home and rinse it out and keep it and it would be a cool thing to have no i went to my car to put it in there where i would not forget it i had my other hand full of stuff so i used the hand holding the robin egg to open my car door crunch
fuck i looked down at the egg and then realized that a very dark brown liquid had leaked out onto my hand keep in mind that it is in the 90 degree range here in iowa with a bright sun too this thing was rotten so that is the story of how my hand smelled like death for a day i washed it off but i do not think i will ever forget that smell
