i 22f am studying abroad in argentina this semester as i am well aware the country is currently in a state of economic distress and as the unemployment rate is extremely high many of the inhabitants have resorted to petty crime such as pickpocketing in an attempt to make ends meet there is the background a few days ago today i did not fuck up but i sure did on saturday morning i was leaving a guys apartment after he had already left to go to work i get myself all ready to go and see half of the joint we had smoke from the night before sitting in the ashtray on the table i have nothing else really to do the rest of the day so i decide to take a few puffs feeling nice and buzzed i put my iphone headphones in my hears turned on my music and went along my way after realizing the commute home would have been a 15 hour long walk i decide to wait at the 124 bus stop there were trucks parked in the spaces in front of the stop so it was difficult to see the bus and to consequently hail it down the woman in front kept walking into the street to see if the bus was coming so i figured i would leave that to her in order to eventually get on the bus this was my first mistake being completely still giving my assailants time to scope me out a few minutes later a man comes up to me and mentions i have a stain on my back and that i should clean it i feel around my coat and find nothing so i continue in my trance from the playlist and the sunny day and the weed and the waiting then another woman comes up and again mentions that there is something on my back at this point i start to feel around my shoulders and when i pull my hand back i see that there is a huge glob of saliva on my skin there are several trails of spit on my clothes fucking gross i also did not know that throwing liquidstrashspitting on people is a means of distraction for pickpocketers awesome yay ignorance while trying to clean myself up i become hazily aware of this woman and her two children standing uncomfortably close to me i was on a busy street and i did not think much of it though my personal space was most definitely invaded i did not even notice my music stop playing all of a sudden she is gone and a street vendor is yelling at me bringing me down to earth telling me that i had just been robbed then it all clicks of course that is what just happened my initial reaction was uh wait what oh what the fuck and i just kept thinking to myself why the fuck did not this vendor intervene while he saw everything happening i mean maybe the people were armed there is many reasons so he tells me that she got onto a bus that was wow just my luck stopped at the red light a few yards away as i confusedly approach i realize that there are three buses all completely stuffed there is no way that i am finding her ever again had my iphone jacked right out from under my nose felt like a total idiot also violated from the saliva shower only solace is that the screen was completely fucked oh well
