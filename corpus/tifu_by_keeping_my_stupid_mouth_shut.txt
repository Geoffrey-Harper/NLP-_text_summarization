well it is more of a 6 month slow mo fuck up the girl i love  who loved me was in the midst of the toughest 2 years anyone has gone through i got so scared of my own shadow constantly afraid of saying the wrong thing that might add more stress to her life that i barely said anything that did not help at all so despite doing everything i could think of to keep our relationship strong she lost many of those feelings for me she needed to rip off some band aids to take back control of her own life and i was one of those band aids think it is painful when you rip off a band aid well imagine what it feels like to be the band aid
