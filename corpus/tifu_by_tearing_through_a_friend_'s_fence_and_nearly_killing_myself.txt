this technically happened yesterday since it 130 am here but i cannot sleep because i am worried before i start let me set the scene it is getting close to 6 on a mildly wet western north carolina summer day not too much rain but enough to get the grass wet and i am in the really mountainous part of wnc so anyway after hanging out with a friend of mine we decide to visit another friend at her house since we are nearby i pull up the driveway see other friends truck in the way so i try to go around the friend i was riding with got wait there is a  out just as i heard a thunk  ditch there got dang it bobby so i get out lo and behold i am stuck if my truck had 4 wheel drive i would not have been as concerned so i try to go further forward i hear a snap well you broke my pipe but that is fine turns out i snapped a 3 inch pvc pipe i guess for drainage and it was now lodged in front of my right front tire now here is where it gets interesting i leave my truck in neutral go out to look at the pipe think oh i can get that out from under there when i do the whole truck comes rolling forward remember mountain country i am stuck on a slope i dodge the truck which hits the girls barn neither the barn nor the truck was hurt but i was pinned between the truck and the barbed wire fence on the passenger side after reassuring everyone there i was a okay one of the girls called her cousin who brought a jeep and a chain i wriggle my way out of the wire ever so carefully step over the wire to make sure i can still have both boys and girls not just one or the other and make my way over to help hook things up and such long story short we get it uphill a little get another truck involved get it angled better cut the fence and i drive my truck down the adjacent field what the fence was there to fence off and everything is okay i ended up with just as many scratches as the truck i just got a text to call the girls mom tomorrow and i am worried that she will tear me a new butthole after this
