this was actually about 4 years ago but i think it qualifies as a fuck up so anyway i was sick with the flu or something i had been home sick for a good week i go to the bathroom to puke what happened next was pretty much one of the dumbest things i have done i was trying to puke into the toilet since i felt like i had to puke but i also felt a fart coming on now i thought it was just a fart wrong i ended up shitting into my pajama pants right there on the floor to make it worse i cannot seem to remember puking so it could have been fucking avoided i then got into the shower and cleaned up twice
