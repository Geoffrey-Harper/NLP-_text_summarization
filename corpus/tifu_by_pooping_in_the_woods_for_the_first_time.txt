this actually happened last weekend and i feel that i need to preface that i am a 28 year old female and i have camped many times but i always make sure to have a potty nearby because my biggest fear is what happened i live in idaho and it is been 100 degrees every day for like a month and a half some friends and i decide to go down to the river and hang out play with the dogs whatever before we left i kind of had to poo but i could not do it it was more of a i am going to have to go eventually kind of thing so we go to a part of the river that i have never been to you have to walk some trails to get down there so we get there and i jump in right away because i have had to pee forever and it is the river that is what you do about 7 minutes after that i realize that i have to go i think to myself that i can hold it i just have to get out of the water for a bit so i go sit down and realize this is not one of those moments this is a monster that has to get out of me so i get out of the water and start walking back towards the trails one of my friends asks where i am going an i have to go so bad i just say illberightback as fast as possible because losing focus on this means i will for sure have feces in my swimsuit i get back to the main trail and start walking along trying to find a place where there is a log or something that i can squat over that is also not in the view of people but it gets so bad that i just said fuck it and found the closest log available i am so lucky that there happens to be a whole dug already so all i have to do is squat down and sit on the log this is where the problem occurs i have a soaking wet swimsuit on that is a pain in the ass to get off and when i get down ready to go i panic my butt is like nope nope nope when it touches the log and i panic so while my body was ready to free this beast my brain was like abort so it starts to go and i am stuck in this almost kneeling position on the ground and i do not know what to do because i cannot stop myself from pooping so i just let it go and i lost my balance and ended up shatting on my foot it was warm and as disgusting as you could imagine i was annoyed and grossed out and panicky at that moment but nothing prepared me for what came next i had nothing to wipe with i look around for leaves or a stick or something anything to end this and then i start to think what if those leaves are poisonous what if the stick gives me splinters i do not want splinters in my butthole luckily i happen to have a shirt on over my swimsuit so i begrudgingly take it off and wipe myself with it i then threw it in the whole and buried the entire remnants of the horrific situation at hand then i had the matter of getting the poo off me instead of going back and facing my friends i walked further down the trail to find a place more secluded than where we were i hope in the river and start washing myself off as best as i can and i glance up and there is a fly fisherman about 25 feet away from me i see him and he turns around like wtf are you doing so i nod and proceed to rinse myself off as quickly as possible i then went back to where my friends were and proceeded to tell them my story they all laughed and told me i was riding on top of the car on the way back
