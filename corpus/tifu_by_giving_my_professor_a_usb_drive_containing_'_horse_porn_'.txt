happened a few quarters ago sorry i only discovered this place recently i was in a helping relationship psychology class where we were given a task to practice one on one relationships with people who had small and manageable problems we were assigned to record our sessions so our professor could check on our responses and tell us how to better work on our methods the file was a little large so i put the recording on a usb stick i got freshman year i wiped it clear on my pc and checked to make sure that nothing was on it i turned it in and thought little of it i got called into her office the next week i walked in pretty casually awaiting my feedback she tells me to take a seat and goes well first of all your file did not work she tried to open it with itunes i think and the audio file was not compatible but more importantly i have to ask you something were you aware that your usb is named horse porn i am not sure i want to open that file anyways care to explain yourself shit
flashback to freshman year i used the same usb stick to pass music and shows between my roommate and i as it turns out he changed the name of my usb stick on his mac which for whatever reason was not visible on pc although i took all the files off the name remained until my professor stumble upon it expecting my assignment anyways i had the opportunity of explaining this to my professor as she laughed her ass of at how flustered i was and how many times i apologized she also made me tell the story the next class and that is what i am currently known for within my major as far as i know
