so here is my story happened just 15 minutes ago i just got back from the gym and had a shower i decided to snap a pic of myself to send to the gf and also just as a general progress pic so anyway here is where the fuck up happens as i opened the picture i pressed this one button which i assumed was the share button once clicked nothing happened i admit at this point i had no clue what just happened so i shrugged it off i was able to press the correct button and send it to the gf however as i am getting changed and heading down to grab some food i start hearing my mum yelling at me very loudly i have nfi what this could be about cos she usually nags me like this but not this loudly at this point i just want to add that i have traditional indian conservative parents as i am walking down she starts asking me what i was doing in the bathroom and why there is a naked selfie of me currently on their 48 tv at this point i start trying to explain half fucking shocked that i was trying to take progress pics and it was an accident eventually after me repeating that same line over and over she let us it go she then goes on to tell me how both her and my dad were watching tv when my picture suddenly appeared i burst into laughter and could not stop laughing as i walked back up the stairs to my room hopefully everything will not be so awkward though i am wishing now that i had one of those neuralizers from men in black to end my humiliation and embarrassment embarrassing but also pure hilarity
