since i was about 10 i have had really bad acne and ultra sensitive skin but it was not until a today headed into my sophomore year in high school that my parents decided i should get epiduo prescription medication for my face i have tried all kinds of medication in the past and they did not work but my parents saw a commercial on the tv and got themselves all excited i went to the dermatologist and she prescribed epiduo which turns out to be an insanely overpriced version of neutrogena i left the doctors and went to walgreens to get my new fancy 200 goop i headed home took a shower put on the new medication and headed out to my golf lesson it is a sunny hot day probably around 90 with no real shade because i am on a golf course after about 20 minutes of being in the sun i started to notice my skin feeling a little tight and dry but i brushed it off because that sometimes happens with new medication as more time passed it started to really burn by the time my lesson was finally over it felt like satan was taking a shit on my face i rushed home and stuck my head in the sink hoping it would quench the fire erupting on my face boy was i wrong the water just made it worse if that was possible warm water was a little better but at that time i was just trying to get the rest of the epiduo off if there was any left while running warm water over my face i decided to read the bottle of that evil goop it says not to mix with other medications and to be careful of using it while in sunlight not only was i outside for an hour an a half in blazing sun i use at least 3 other types of prescription medication guess my dermatologist just forgot to warn me its been two hours since my golf lesson and my skin is just staring to cool off i just looked in the mirror and it looks like i have been severely sunburned and my skin is sheddingi probably will not be using epiduo or ever going outside again
