technically it was not today but last friday hope you forgive me there also forgive the bad english of a spanish speaker so im a nervous guyand this week the money my parents gave me for college went away faster than usual because i had to buy some groceries on my apartment that i didnt account for now i do not have a debit card so i cannot get money from my savings that easily so naturally i do not tell anything to my parents about me running out of money and i try to solve the situation myself by asking my friend to lend me some money which i end up missmanaging and by friday morning i had only enough money to return to my apartment and that is it as i was pretty much bankrupt and i had to attend to some classes saturday morning i give up and end up asking my parents to send me money at this point all that goes through my mind is how bankrupt i am and how likely it is that money will not come on time and ill find myself with nothing to eat on saturday morning so i was not paying attention while i took the bus back home the bus drivers where i live are pretty much insane and policemen apparently do not care about this so it was perfectly logical for the bus driver to skip a red light and go down my street at a 100kmh instead of 40kmh in this moment i realize i will miss my stop and there are no set stops for the bus on my country outside of the capital city so i yell at the guy to stop of course he cant go from a hundred to 0 in the half second that it would take him to get to my street the guy slows down to 30kmh by the moment he gets to my stop and i for some reason thought i could be a badass and jumprun out of the bus whithout fall damage because well my mind was all over the place about money so i jumped from a moving bus at 30kmh and the inevitable happens i wreck my ankle like a total dumbass and end up on the floor with gravel on my mouth in front of the now fully stopped bus with people checking on me from the windows out of pure shame i stand up and signal them that i am ok and walk all the way to my apartment approx 200m plus straircases i lay on my bed and try to forget the incident by browsing reddit fast forward 3 hours and my ankle already is the size of a melon a small melon and i cannot bear the pain luckily this is also the moment that my cousin who was sent to give me the money my parents were sending me gets to the apartment so i ask him to get me to the hospital long story short i had a sprain and my tibia and fibula are half a cm more separated than they were supposed to be which earns me a cast a 300 bill with my cousin and a lot of explaining to do at college to all the proffesors i end up owing exams and to my already pissed parents
