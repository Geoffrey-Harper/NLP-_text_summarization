now it is at this moment in a phone call like this i hang up but i am having a good morning and i want to see where this goes so i let him continue    
r this coin online says it is worth 300 me that coin you have specifically is it in a case of some kind r no me well i do apologize sir we cannot guarantee that coin specifically is worth that amount unless it is been professionally graded and cased we can certainly try to get as close to that value as possible but i would need to look at it first rwhere are you located this is where i throw my punch inmetaphorically speaking    
me we are in the same location you were just at r which is you know whathow do you stay in business with your smart mouth i mute the phone me by putting it on your moms box r i was treated poorly by the guy in there and i was lied to i demand to know your name    
mute the phone bj cobbledick 
r and who your supervisor is me the guy who films your mom and i fucking mute the phone 
r what now all the yelling and verbal beating is warranted he said he would be down and that he expects to see my supervisor hopefully he goes back to the place he went to the first time or he was just blowing smoke and will not do anything at all
