i woke up this morning somewhat hungover after another night of heavy drinking it was about 1pm and time for lunch so i went to the kitchen i live at home and my stepmom was making lunch she said spillomanen if i make us some wraps then you make us something to drink and who could possibly say no to such an offer i grab a water bottle for our sodastream machine and poured the elderflower and apple syrup into the water no biggie i attached the water bottle with syrup in it to the sodastream and pushed to button to fill it with carbon dioxide and then it all went to hell the pressure in the water bottle became way too high in a matter of seconds gas and soda was being forced out of the sodastream spraying everything in a radius of 40cm a mix of being kind of stunned by this unforseen event and my brain still not working properly  i thought i got to release the bottle from the machine that will end it all as that seemed like the only reasonable thing to do i grabbed the bottle and loosened it from the sodastream an explosion of elderflower soda sprayed everything in an even greater radius than before and then everything became quiet i stood still for a couple of seconds trying to come to terms with what the hell just happend and i realized i reversed the process of making this damn soda carbon dioxide then syrup i spend the next 15 minutes wiping down the kitchen while my stepmom was laughing at me
