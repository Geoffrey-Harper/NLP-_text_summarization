this was actually a few weeks ago but over the course of my relationship with my girlfriend we have shared quite a lot of intimate texts between each other among those however are the rest of our texts usually filled with sweet messages thoughtful things important life events etc i have my phone set to back up all of my texts and upload them to my dropbox account which is synced with my computer one day i had to help share a file between my computer and my brothers i set up my dropbox account on his computer so that the file transfer could be easier little did i know his computer would not only have access to my files but be notified when a new file was uploaded a few days later my phone uploads the recent backup of my texts and my brother sees it since it had a weird file name he opened it to make sure it was not some virus sure enough the first text he sees is the beginning of a sext from my girlfriend going into much detail about how we want to fuck each other and how horny we are he did not read the whole thing but now my younger knows about my sex life in excruciating detail edit
