throwaway for obvious reasons so i am 14 and discovered masturbation a few months ago   this is to be expected of people to start watching porn and stuff i had a soundcloud account linked to my facebook and started listening to some porn to get me off it normally helps me so since it is linked i start listening to some of that shit i start masturbating and then i get a call from my mom pause stop answer hello hi  i saw on your facebook you are watching 
me being in total and utter shock um what it says you were watching _ on facebook ohit does i start denying everything i then tell my mom i will do something hang up and delete my account hoping that the info will disappear now here is my favorite part i call my mom back and explain to her i deleted my account which i never even used and she says it is okay for boys my age to explore sexual content she was okay with it but it was still super awkward nonetheless i appreciate how my mom knows it is okay and that it is normal and does not mind edit 1 i was home alone as well edit 2 rgonewildaudio shout it
