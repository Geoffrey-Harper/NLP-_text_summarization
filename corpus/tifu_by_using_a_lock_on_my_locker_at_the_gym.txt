it is been a couple weeks since i would been to the gym i got sick i started a new job life was generally being shitty and in the way after some gentle encouragement from my girlfriend i agreed that i really did need to get back on it and go back to working out cue yesterday first day back to the gym i had lost my old lock but i had the one from my locker at my last job so i just brought that with me i show up get changed and work out when i get done with my workout i go back in the locker room grab my soap a towel and underwear lock my locker and go shower i finished my shower walked out and up to my locker and my heart sank you can probably imagine why my old lock was a combination lock the one from my locker at work was a key lock my keys were inside my locker there i stood wet cold and in my boxers staring at my locker and the empty locker room and contemplating my next move after a few minutes alone in the locker room i realized nobody else was going to be able to help me because nobody else was in there so i braved the journey from the locker room to the front desk here is where it gets worse    the entire gym is one big room with mirrors around the perimeter if you are in the gym people can see you it was late but not late enough that the gym was empty as an added bonus the mens locker room is the room second furthest away from the front desk oh and i should also mention that i am quite an ahem portly individual so i walked up to the front desk damp and in my underwear and faced the unfortunately female front desk attendant as if my luck was not bad enough now somebody from the other gender was the one i had to ask for help in front of god and everybody in my underwear much to my relief the gym has a set of bolt cutters which she lent to me so i could go get my locker open i trekked across the gym now looking more ridiculous than before in my underwear holding a bolt cutter i made it back to my locker cut the lock got dressed and walked back up i returned the bolt cutter and made it a priority to get the fuck outta there as fast as i could hopefully nobody that is in there tonight was there last night but chances are i will not get so lucky
