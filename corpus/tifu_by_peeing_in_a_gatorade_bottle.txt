so last night i had a couple of people over and i got pretty drunk after my friends depart from my place i am feeling exhausted and want to go straight to bed but first i had to piss so i drain the pipes and head upstairs to my room still drunk i decided to browse the internet for a little bit i realized i was way too exhausted so after about 10 15 minutes of browsing i close my laptop turn on my ac turn off the lights and hop in bed which felt fucking amazing after a long day as soon as i snuggle in my sheets i have the urge to piss yet again and its barely been fucking 15 minutes now my upstairs room is an addition to my house and there is no bathroom upstairs so this would require me to walk to the opposite side of my house just to get to the stairs and go all the way back to the same side of the house my room is on to get the bathroom fuck that i am way to lazy for that shit so i see an empty gatorade bottle in my trash can by my bed and decide to just piss in there and throw it out the next morning so there i went draining the pipes yet again but in a gatorade bottle when i finished i for some reason decided to put the gatorade bottle back next to my bed on my nightstand i wake up the next morning still half asleep and thirsty as a motherfucker without even thinking i grab the gatorade bottle and start to drink my vegetated piss once the warm salty liquid reached my tongue i had realized my mistake which then made me spew it out all over my pillow the thought of me drinking my own piss then made me yak all over my bed i had two of the three bodily excretions spattered on my pillowbed
