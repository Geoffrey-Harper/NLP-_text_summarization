my friends and i were in a car at a local park tonight suddenly 7 cars sped out of the parking lot in formation my friend got instantly excited and followed we thought we were going to see some fucked up shit the anticipation was unreal we  even followed them into the next town they eventually parked in a sketchy area when we parked we saw them all get out and they were only a large latino family biggest disappointment ever
