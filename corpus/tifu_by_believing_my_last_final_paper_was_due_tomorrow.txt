so today i had two exam finals and i believed a paper final due tomorrow then i would be done or so i thought i had recently passed a macroeconomics course i had failed the last semester so i thought everything was golden today i drag myself out of bed after studying all night for my 730am final go home study some more for my 130pm final and head off to class i get to my 130pm final and begin talking to the guy who sits next to mewho just happens to be in my class with the paper final i thought was due tomorrow some friends of mine come in and as we are talking i let it slip i have a paper i need to write for tomorrow the guy i was talking to before interjects and with a look of pity informs me that our paper final was due today i immidately panic and type out an email to my professor in hopes he takes pity on me th problem is i have had him for two other classes and the one time he will not take a late paper is the final exam so i effectively have failed a class with my favorite professor also i am part of a new sorority forming on campus but my gpa for the semester has to be over a 20 
edit i also almost got hit by a car twice today update
my professor answered the very apologetic email with a these things happen have a good break which pretty much means that i am in trouble with my grade now i have got all my other class grades reported except him i am just waiting for the damage but i have already accepted the worst
