so a little background i work in a manufacturing plant and today my job was to run parts out of our automatic press well i loaded a coil of stock onto the  feeder first fu i did not pay attention to which way the burr was facing on the coil now this does not seem important but when you run it through the straightner it affects the way the stock is flattened so this is where the second fu comes in second fu i only used to banding straps instead of three well again does not seem like much but that third band keeps the material from twisting while coiled up well as soon as i tried to move it it shifted and turned into this now i cannot just scrap it because it is a 2000ft coil that costs about 1200 so i have to rewind the coil by hand this is the rig i came up with to rewind the coil after two and half hours httpiimgurcomgphlzpvjpg
