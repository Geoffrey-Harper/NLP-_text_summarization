so my oven is brokenand i am out of cooking oil but i want some french fries so i search the internet and find that if you cover french fries with something either napkins or another plate and microwave them they turn out ok so i tried it i took to plates smushed them together and put the french fries in the microwave do not try this at home 
 half way through the five minute cooking cycle i pull the plate out steam billowing out the crack between the two plates i lift off the top plate and let it cool down a but i touch the french fry and it is warm but a tad bit cold i feel around and flip them with my fingers genius and then i reach the center of the plate freeze frame have you ever microwaved something like chicken nuggets and the nuggets near the edge of the plate are colder than the ones in the middle well this is exactly what happened but a thousand times worse since the fries have been blanched frozen bagged and then put into my freezer that means there is still some oil in the fries and the microwave brought out that oil and boiled it 
 so i was poking around the fries when my finger squishes into a really soft one right into the hell fire center where broiling hot potato smushes under my finger nail i jump back in shock and flail around my hand whispering ow stop ow stop ow stop i cover the plate start the microwave and walk away suddenly this burning sensation just erupts over the tip of my finger full on pain train i step into the bathroom and run it under cold water only to find out we are out of burn cream so now i am sitting at my desk with first degree burns on my index finger which i stuck in a bag of frozen corn 
as i type with one hand update i put aloe vera on the end of my finger and it feels like little tiny snow angels grinding up against my finger so gud
