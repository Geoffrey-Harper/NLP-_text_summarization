to make days go by faster at work i brought in a portable music speaker that i can set up wherever i am working so today i was moved into a hall to clean floors while a cleaning crew worked on the walls i plug in my ipod so we can all listen to music while working this was in the morning and everything went fine until after lunch the hall i was working in does not have a restroom and the nearest one is right around the hall corner i leave my music plugged in to the speaker and go off to relieve myself all is fine in the restroom but stepping into the hall i quickly realized my mistake killing in the name of was playing and blaring loud fuck yous throughout the halls i fumbled around with the speakers grabbed my ipod and went off to hide in shame from everyone else
