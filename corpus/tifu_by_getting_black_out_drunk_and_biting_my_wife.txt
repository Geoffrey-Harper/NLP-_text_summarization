a wee bit of backstory i do not drink hard liquor i do not like it and it does not like me i can drink wine and beer regularly with little to no issue but stay away from the hard stuff amongst my friends and family there is a standing ban against two types of liquor specifically vodka because it makes me cry like a baby and tequila because i will attempt to have sex with pretty much anything now i think whiskey will be added to that list the story my wife and i are prepping up for a night of pizza booze tv at the liquor store and i reach for my old familiar 6 pack she says that she is bored with beer and had heard one of her friends talking about how delicious rye whiskey and lemonade are so i consent and grab a bottle we get home and start mixing drinks and the mixture is quite delicious it has the sweet tang of lemonade and the oaky warmth of whiskey but zero alcohol taste this is a bad thing the drunker i get the less i can taste the alcohol so the stronger i make the drinks so the drunker i get and it snowballs from there my next memory is waking up the next morning still very drunk and feeling like i have been trampled by a team of horses my wife has already left for work an hour ago so i get dressed rather sloppily and head out myself i carpool and it was not my day to drive so i did not drive drunk i make it there and get settled in with a muffin to soak up the alcohol and text my wife to see why i am so sore her reply you bit me and i kicked the shit out of you i go to the bathroom and lock the door and take off my shirt to find my side and shoulder to be one giant bruise these are the events of the evening as pieced together from my wifes story i drank most of the bottle of whiskey by myself she had two drinks with 2 shots each and i had the rest i was not able to make it through the daily show and colbert report so my wife drug me to bed and tried to have sex with me by this point i apparently had unprecedented levels of whiskey dick so that was not going to happen and i just yelledsobbed drunkenly into my pillow for a while she finds the quite amusing and starts jokingly saying things like about me being impotent which i am not normally just so she can laugh at my over the top responses eventually i just get annoying and it late so she rolls over and tries to go to sleep accidentally pulling the covers off of me so i do what any rational person would do and bite her and not a nibble either i lock on like a pitbull and do not let go apparently i also pull her hair my wife slugs me in the forehead until i let go then a few more times in the side of the head and the shoulderrib area for good measure before kicking me literally out of bed she is not mad in fact she finds it quite hilarious but i have never felt worse mentally or physically and it does not help when she makes spousal abuse jokes edit  some words
