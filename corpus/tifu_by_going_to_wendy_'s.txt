so my day pretty much sucked let us start off with the shitty morning of me waking up early at 730 so i just sit on my couch and recollect my thoughts of my daily chores half asleep my mother comes upstairs saying we need to help my 90 year old grandmother shit just hit the fan
so we scarf down a leftover pancake and head out to the car we drive 2 blocks down the street to my grandmothers crappy old house we push her out in her rickety old wheelchair to the 90 degree car as she bitches and moans about how she does not wand to go outside and she wants to stay home and catch up on her shows now mind you when she is home she constantly complains about being lonely she does have a caretaker who does not speak fluent english so when you combine that with a defective hearing old lady you get a serious tornado of confusion we drive to the mall and walk around macys and all the terrible woman stores that my mother drags me to but after about 3 4 hours we decide it is insanely hot and why not get some ice cream ohhh ho ho hooo that was the moment of truth we drove to wendys and ordered four chocolate frosty shake things we drive around the neighborhood so everyone can indulge on the fine delicacy that is chocolate but this was no delicacythis was satans very shit in my cup after about 23 of my ice cream demolished by my sweet tooth i felt a shit coming on so i asked my mom to politely pull in front of my house so i may rush to the bathroom i sit down as a stream of brown liquid floods the porcelain throne in which i sit oh god the full blown squirts 4 times in the past 2 hours have i shit the milky ooze my toilet is clogged and i still have to shit at this point my anus has the grand canyon tearing through my buttcheeks i take a shower to cleanse by bungholio of its pain i apply some cream to stop the burn that was a mistake i have never felt such pain in my ass it cannot be put into words and it still burns now an hour later
