i did some nude photographymodeling a few years back and while i love the pieces i did and do not regret them in the slightest i do not particularly want seeing my friends especially male friends seeing me nude mostly because i have body issues like every other woman it seems i was browsing reddit and noticed a familiar photo it was an old photo of me that someone had posted to gonewildplus with another photo in the comments i was surprised to see it and was having some feels about it i was in chat with several people at once bouncing between several different conversations one of them being a good friend who i sent the link to the guys profile but not the post itself because she had something similar happen to her however when i was sending the link i popped not into her box but a box right next to her a box with my male friend i immediately noticed my mistake and though it was not a link to the direct post i know that photo was only one click away and it was the newest post i profusely apologized and told him to please not open it he conceded and told me he even cleared the chat log so he would not be tempted to open it he also told me to thank my lucky stars that i must be special because he would not ordinarily do that and before you naysayers come in and say he did look at him trust me if he had he would have made some sort of nice tits joke
