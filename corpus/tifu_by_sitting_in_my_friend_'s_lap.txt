technically this is more of a three years ago i fucked up but i digress
back in the good old school days we had friday sport this term myself and a group of friends decided to join the representative touch footy team and we were waiting for the bus to take us to our semi final match my friend was sitting on the side of the grassy hill where we were waiting and yelled oi come over here and patted her lap so naturally i went over and jumped into her lap in a weak attempt to crush her legs much laughing ensued which attracted the attention of our other friends so we ended up in a pile of about 10 resembling a pile of stacked up chairs one of my teachers noticed and walked over to us shaking his head slightly of course what is the most natural response to seeing a stack of people sitting in each others laps push the stack so with eight people in front of me with some pretty serious weight adding up there we fell over sideways as the laughter increased tenfold i heard a very faint clicking sound feeling my leg tense up i looked down bad move about five centimetres to the right of my leg was my knee cap hanging or levitating as it appeared from my angle in midair so after a number of very unladylike expletives and a bit of yellingscreaming people noticed that my knee cap had attempted to escape my leg and called an ambulance then the bus showed up so while my friends went to sport and got their asses kicked by a fellow high school i sat on the side of the hill with my fucked up leg the paramedics show up and ask if they can try and put my knee cap back in place without pain killers at this point the extremely light spring breeze which is flowing feels like razor blades cutting into my tendons so i was not exactly keen on this idea so they picked up the end of my leg and pulled i think i punctured an eardrum screaming they realise that this might not be the best plan so i am bundled up onto a stretcher and head off to hospital driving in an ambulance with a dislocated knee cap was never on my bucket list but at least i have crossed it off when i arrive at the hospital i am finally given the good pain killers nitrous oxide for the win none of that green whistle shit and the er physio walks in it took three people to stabilise me while he pulled my foot and twisted behold my knee cap finally pops back in they waited for me to come down of the high of the nitrous before fitting me in a knee brace and crutches note for the wise   a knee brace which holds your leg completely straight thus making one leg longer than the other will fuck you over worst two weeks ever after a month with crutches a knee brace and some really pleasant taping physiotherapy and an inability to climb stairs easily my knee was finally released from its self induced prison i have never sat in that friends lap again i also got an a in geography from that teacher at the end of that term edit
