i would been planning to switch banks for some time now i have been stewing and stewing over the fact that my bank has started assessing a 6 monthly service fee if your account balance falls below 500 during any time during the previous month so they are charging me for being poor if i was wealthy and could maintain a high balance the account would be free that just seems horribly wrong to me so today was payday i took my check to the bank and told them i wanted to keep out part of it in cash and deposit the rest into the account the lady said i am sorry since this check is drawn on a different bank i am going to have to deposit the whole thing and it will become available to you first thing tomorrow morning but i cannot give you any cash out of it today i replied with okay why do i even have an account with you then i am just going to come inside and close out my account i went inside expressed my opinions about their monthly being poor fee and the fact that they would not give me my money most verbosely calling them useless and the most un helpful and uncaring bank i have ever used about an hour or so later it hit me on february first i filed my federal income taxes and scheduled my hefty return to be direct depositedinto the bank account that i had just closed
where is my pride i seem to have lost it i have had a bit of indigestion lately i think maybe i swallowed it the last time i saw it was right before i called the bank apologized and begged them to reopen my account which they were kind enough to do preventing me from having to wait months and months while the irs kept my refund tied up in limbo
