it was last october but i am feeling the fall out from it the most today after my mom died from cancer last year i started looking for my estranged father i had only known him for a short time when i was 6 and barely remembered more than his name i never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain so i did not push her for information about him i figured he did not care about us i had googled him multiple times over the years but he was always unlisted and i did not have an address with which to search after her death i felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that i have a beautiful little girl it felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us i googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic i called figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since i would already experienced that several times while looking for him it was not i had no idea how he would react to me but he was ecstatic he told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he did not pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable he said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me he was right about that my mom was the best woman i have ever known so we started talking and skyping we spent a lot of time learning about each other knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be but i tried to believe that people can change for the better he was exactly everything i needed in a father my entire life  supportive sweet funny loving eventually i told him that i loved him after months of talking with him he was over the moon fast forward to actually meeting him in person this is the part where without knowing my dad or me you might feel that i sound like an ass i say this because i do not have a precise reason or event that i can point to as to why i do not trust him why he actually makes me really nervous my dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time he does not smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled he does not give personal space and when i spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer he kept coming in to my room to check on me while i was sleeping he said that he was just so excited to have me there that he could not help it but i really felt uncomfortable with it i could not sleep and was so glad that i did not even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first he also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does i said no and he accepted that but the constant touchiness continued it was not anything strictly inappropriate but it made my skin crawl i have spent very little actual time with him in person maybe 2 weeks total over several trips i have however talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype during the most acute months of grieving for my mom he was so devoted to me trying to talk me through whatever he could i was so grateful for it that i kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me he actually demanded a lot of my time like hours and hours every day and would get upset if i cited my daughter and husband as reasons that i needed to chill with the phone he never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life he also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once again i know people can change but at this point i find myself wanting less contact with him the idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns i do not want to hurt him but i just cannot trust him i do not even know if i am asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone thank you for reading and i sincerely want to wish all the wonderful fathers out there a very happy fathers day eta
