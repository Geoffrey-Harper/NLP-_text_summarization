this actually happened a long time ago and is actually one of my earliest memories of throwing up when i was about eight i was at a party in my neighborhood when my stomach started to act up i decided to walk home to go to the bathroom because i thought i needed to poop i made it to my bathroom but nothing was conning out after straining to push something out for a good 5 minuets my face suddenly explodes with vomit i end up soaking a rug in my bathroom and covering the floor with my puke i think the only reason i remember this is because it was the first time vomit ever came out my nose an it hurt like a bitch
