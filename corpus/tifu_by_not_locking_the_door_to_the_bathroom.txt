my fuck up actually started yesterday when i ate panda express for lunch and then mcdonalds for dinner i am usually a really healthy eater so the introduction of this food into my system has not been treating me well today so i was back in the bathroom to shit for the fourth time today and when i entered the bathroom i was talking on the phone and i forgot to lock the door i should mention the bathroom i was using was a male bathroom it has a urinal and a stall with a toilet but because of the flow of people it has been converted into a unisex bathroom that you are supposed to lock while in use so i am in there just blowing shit everywhere and talking on the phone i should also add that considering the door was locked i did not shut the stall door and i sat with my pants and boxers all the way to the floor rather than up around my knees like people usually do in a stall because no one was supposed to walk in well the next thing i know i hear someone turn the handle but to my surprise the next thing i know someone is walking in i scramble and shut the stall door and lock it as fast as i can and i hear them say something when they noticed someone was inside but they promptly left i stand up and waddle over to the door and lock it and sit back down and continue on with my business the person i was on the phone with was obviously wondering what the fuck was going on and when i tell her what just happened she begins to laugh her ass off and she cannot stop laughing and is laughing so hard we have to cut our phone conversation short i spend a lot of time hoping whoever it was that walked in on me will be out of proximity of the bathroom by the time i leave so i attempt to sneak from the bathroom back to my office but i was spotted by the office secretary who noticeably turns and is obviously wondering who the fuck she walked in on in the bathroom shitting and yeah it was me and she knows itfuck edit typo
