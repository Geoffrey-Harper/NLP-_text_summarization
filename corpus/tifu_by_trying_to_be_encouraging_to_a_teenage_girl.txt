i am a childrens librarian in a small town where everyone seems to know each other part of my job is working with our volunteers a very nice girl about 14 started volunteering a couple of weeks ago one of my co workers knows her family and we were talking about her before her shift one day turns out this girl is from a wealthy family is extremely popular all the normal things that makes me regress into my old angsty i hate pretty girls mentality this girl is actually really nice and very interested in library work so i put away my stupid baggage and continue to be encouraging to her one day during a lull we start talking about our families just basic do you have any brothers or sisters kind of stuff she starts talking about her brothers and how they do not get along i share my experience with my family and tell her you know things may seem bad now but when you get older and move out of your parents house you are going to miss your brothers and parents all of the little fights you have turn into funny stories so just try to enjoy the time you get to spend under the same roof with your brothers and then i say as long as nothing really bad happens to you or your family i am sure you will look back favorably on your time together she responds with 3 years ago my dad gave up on life edited for spelling
