it is the start of a glorious weekend getting home from a long day hanging out with close friends getting the occasional call or text message to jump from one activity to the next early evening i receive a text from what i believed at the time was a beautiful yet intelligent woman i had been texting earlier that day she is flirting with me i am flirting back and all is going smoothly this sort of stuff carries on for the next few hours until she she says she has to walk home from a local fast food restaurant i ask her which establishment that she had dined actually would not call this dining but rather eating out that particular evening she says that it was one that was particularly close by i begin to ask whether she had moved from one home to another one close by she says no at the time this did not raise a red flag next day we text back and forth the usual winky face and the cliche flirtatious remark is made towards one another and i am thinking to myself  wow could this be going any better but then reality struck i received a call from the attractive woman that i had been texting the previous day and i looked at the number thinking oh god what have i done soon i scrolled through my text messages realizing that i was texting an obese not so attractive male associate of mine in shock i instantly told the attractive female what the situation was she laughed of course at what had happened i still have yet to reply to the male associate of mine in fear of the awkwardness that has ensued
