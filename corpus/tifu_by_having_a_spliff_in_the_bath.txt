i have not had a bath in practically years so after finally moving into a house with a bath i decide to have one having recently purchased a shiny new bag of weed i thought combining the two would be a good idea picture this a very cramped bathroom no windows a shitty extractor fan closed door steaming hot bath and a spliff as i lay there gently swishing to and fro giggling like a little school girl i neglected to notice how hot the room was becoming after a while i looked up and realised i could barely even see the taps in front of me naturally i begin to panic and started scrambling around trying to escape i grabbed a towel stood up and immediately fell back to the floor all i could see was black for what felt like 5 minutes my heart was pounding and i could feel the blood rushing past my ears once the feeling passed i stumbled into my bedroom and stood in front of the mirror facing me was an extremely red version of myself with a bleeding shoulder currently my heart rate has almost returned to normal and i am starting to feel and look less like a lobster 210 would not recommend
