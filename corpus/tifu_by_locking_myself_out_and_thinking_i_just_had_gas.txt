every day i drive to a park and ride which is about 2 miles away from my place well this morning as i was leaving i left my keys on the counter and locked the door on the way out it was both my car keys and my condo keys and i had no way back in my wife had left for work 5 minutes earlier i tried calling her and she did not answer so i decided to walknot three steps down the stairs i felt a fart coming oni let it out slowly because i have not been feeling great lately and i felt a wet juicy fart slip out of my cheeks only it was not just a fart it was diarrhea it was not a lot but enough to feel terrible i had no choice though but to walk and of course living the greater seattle area it started raining it was a 25 minute walk then a 30 minute bus ride with runny crap between my cheeks the only good news was that when i got to work my underwear was not too badly stained
