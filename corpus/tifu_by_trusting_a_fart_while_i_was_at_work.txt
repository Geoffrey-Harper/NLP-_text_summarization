this one is pretty cut and dry
work in a very small office when one uses the bathroom there is no question about whether it is 1 or 2 thought since nobody was upstairs that i had clearance to let one rip i immediately regretted that decision a faster than usual dash to the bathroom probably alerted everyone downstairs that there was something amiss as soon as i sat down on the toilet i reached for the tp so i could check the damage 3 fucking squares left3 results from the first one indicated that this was going to be a fucking mess so i did what i had to do   folded that bitch in half and used it twice every square inch of clean white paper was going to be needed if i was going to get out of this without having to go home for lunch by some miracle the last square indicated a clean surface but by this time i had been in there way longer than a 1 so nobody used the bathroom the rest of the day and i had to go downstairs and get more tp out of the closet in front of everyone just to put to rest any doubt in their minds as to whether or not pooping was going on little did they know
