warning  wall of text which could easily be viewed as really fucking boring
the background of the relationship is that we had met online and had not met yet he lives 200 miles away from where i live but my lifes rather busy and he does not have a job right now unemployment in his region is over 50 so i do not blame him he is a very kind sweet human being and i probably would have been lucky to end up with him now i am not from the country i am currently studying in but i would like to end up here eventually it seemed that the stars had aligned in showing me that there was hope for love here boy was i wrong there is a huge secessionist movement within a different region one which neither of us live in which has been gaining traction over the years especially with the recent economic collapse i am a lover of said region it is the place where i feel the most comfortable in the entire world  the people the cuisine the culture all of it just fits he however does not feel the same way about this region i already knew that but it had been bothering me since he had called people from there obnoxious sheeps sic amongst other things we have always had different communication styles i am a fucking loudmouth and he is rather reserved but we had been making it work this morning however i could not hold back some of my worries and amongst other things i mentioned how he wants to live in an entirely different country and how i would not the  
i do not know what else to say really i debated with him my point as best as i could calling out flaws in his argument about the nature of the secessionist movement and the national identity of the people from that region for a while i thought he could at least be tolerant of my deep regard for it but it would appear that even that was impossible i got fed up with his ad hominem attacks on me and on the people who live out there and i told him he can act like a child all he likes but it does not make a whole group of people terrible just for their geographical location tbph i am a bit numb to it all in january i had a whirlwind romance which tore me to pieces by the end of it and having this happen without ever even meeting to see if we are compatible in the real world welp i am just done with men for a while i do not feel anything and my only reaction to this whole thing was to clean my room and wash my sheets in a fervor he apparently felt awful that he would lost my respect but rather i deleted him from all of our sources of communication which i did so i would not have to deal with his remorse i am not sure if i really fucked up today but it would have been nice to at least have tried to make things work instead of leaving things off on such a sour note cest la vie
