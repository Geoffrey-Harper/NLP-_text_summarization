i will admit this did not just happen today this was years ago but i thought you all would enjoy it i was 18 years old and had just moved out of my apartment about a month prior an acquaintance of mine moved into the same apartment block as me a month before i moved out this is important she held a party one summer evening at her apartment and i attended with some friends i should say at the time i was known as a guy that likes to drink tonight was no exception bring on the whiskey cue blackout you know when you wake up from a night of heavy drinking and your memories are just flashes of pictures you string them along creating a hazy timeline picture
me stumbling down the stairs
i am hungry

me standing at the drive through window
you need a car to use the drive through we cannot serve you when i wake up after drinking way too much alcohol my consciousness comes in stages first i became aware of my body i am uncomfortable and cold why do i not have a blanket what the fuck am i laying on a 35lbs weight i open my eyes and see i am sleeping on the ground and in what appears to be a weight room i was sleeping next to the bench press things start churching in my disoriented hungover mind as i started recognizing my surroundings and i begin to panic i was in my old bedroom how the fuck did this happen i tried thinking of ways out of this i put my head to the door and could hear voices a male and a female can i climb out the window no that is a long fall there was only one way out of this and i knew what i had to do with my ear against the door i lightly knocked i heard a gasp and a murmur there was no turning back now i opened the door and came out with my hands up the new apartment owners were an asian couple in their mid 20s and the they were not very happy to see me i immediately tried to explain that i used to live here i do not know how this happened please do not call the cops or kick my ass i told him i still had a key to the apartment as i was never told to turn it in and never bothered to take it off my keyring i figured the locks would get changed i gave him the key and he told me to empty my pockets to show i did not steal anything we were at a standstill and he was seriously considering calling the cops and do you blame him imagine that cooking breakfast with your significant other on a sunday morning when some haggard looking stranger comes wallowing out of your weight room how do you react to that he eventually let me go he told me to never come back to that apartment complex i agreed and left i ran faster than i have ever ran i must have ran a good mile before i stopped and called my friend to pick me up apparently i told them i was going to get some food and never came back to the party turned my cellphone off and said fuck it
