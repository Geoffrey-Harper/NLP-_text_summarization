i had my electronics class today and my professor gave us an assignment where we have to make something from nothing nothing being the broken computers and other electronics that we could find in our workroom my group decided to build a boat because honestly hot gluing a block of styrofoam to a cpu fan is the easiest idea that any of us could think of but we wanted to get a bit more creative we found a couple of speakers in an old bin and one with the audio output still intact with an auxiliary headphone cable so we decided to play around with them a bit and see if we could mount them on our boat before we began work on them we had to see that they worked so i took the speaker with the intact audio output plugged it into my phone hooked up the speaker to the oscillator kicked it up to five volts and started playing a song on my phone little did i know that the current would travel through the speaker up the auxiliary cable into my phones audio input where the battery beyond had a maximum load capacity of only three point eight volts i literally held my phone in my hands as the voltage fried my motherboard and the screen turned black never to turn on again
