so to start off i am 13 years old and this all happened last sunday i was messing around not thinking and was swirling a half dollar in between my teeth as unlucky as i was it slipped in between my teeth went down my throat tried to cough it up made it even worse and completely swallowed the damned thing without a problem i still wonder how i did not choke on it well i tell my parents that it was just a qauter to lessen tension on them and go along the week until friday hoping it would pass my hopes were nothing but crushed as 5 days go by without passage so on friday we go and get an xray and waddya know its still stuck in my stomach two days go on and were still hoping for the best suddenly my little brother gets a stomach virus and starts vomiting all over bad news since its still in my stomach by then or as i thought if i threw up it might come up and i could choke in it of course as luck would have it i wake up only to start projectile vomiting all over the damn bathroom the quarter did not come out luckily but we still needed to go to the er to make sure i was safe so today i spent a good 5 hours in the er got two x rays done to find out it passed into my colon but because it is so big there is a chance it might not pass and i would have to get surgery but there is also the possibility that it could just rip right through my colon causing me the worst pain of my life and giving me a colin bag for my shit if i live on the outside of my body forever of course that is only a 1 chance but its still there just wonderful i am praying to god i shit this thing out and be done with this burden here is an update it has not passed and most likely going to get a tube up the ass and get it pulled out pleasant
